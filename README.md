# Shadcn Music Qwik ⚡️

This project is an experiment. Qwik is great, but React's powerful ecosystem should not be wasted. This project uses qwik-react to run the [Music App in @shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/music), and the CSS solution uses unocss. It combines perfectly with vite. The DX is even better. The [demo](https://shadcn-music-qwik.pages.dev/) is hosted on Cloudflare Page


## Update
- [Fri Sep 29 01:10:09 CST 2023]: The issue with associating a color variable to the unocss version used in the code has been [resolved](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/issues/2672). Now hsl colors can be configured like in Tailwind.
