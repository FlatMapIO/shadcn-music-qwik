# Shadcn Music Qwik ⚡️

This project is an experiment. Qwik is great, but React's powerful ecosystem should not be wasted. This project uses qwik-react to run the [Music App in @shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/music), and the CSS solution uses unocss. It combines perfectly with vite. The DX is even better. The [demo](https://shadcn-music-qwik.pages.dev/) is hosted on Cloudflare Page
